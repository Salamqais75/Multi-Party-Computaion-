	the test we make we take two random numbers each for alice and four for bob that each, thr numbers are between 0 and 3.
	each number represnt one cekk in the vector (vector a OR vector x) A=(a1,a2), X=(x1,x2)
	if the output as expected that if a1x1+a2x2 >=4 return 1 else 0 if that happened the test will print passed else will print 	
	an error message in that way we will test our protocol.
