THE TEST : 
	the test we make we take four random bits each for alice and four for bob that each
	two bits represent a number from the vetor like this alice_inupt_vec = [b1,b2,b3,b4] so (b1,b2) = x1 ,(b3,b4) = x2
	the same for bob and then we will run the protocol for this inputs and we will check
	if the output as expected that if a1x1+a2x2 >=4 return 1 else 0 if that happened the test will print passed else will print 	
	an error message in that way we will test our protocol.
